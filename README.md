Original Redorahn flat screen project by MaytoD/curious planet found here: https://www.curious-planet.com/redorahn/

Just download the project in "releases" and run the .exe.  Controls are included when the game boots into the level for about 20 seconds on the screen.

Report any issues in "Issues" and I will try my best but I think this works pretty well now, played through to about 50,000 points and death.

See the license files for specific licenses applicable to each part of the project.
